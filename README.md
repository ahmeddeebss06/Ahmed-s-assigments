# Final Assignment - Mobile Training

A comprehensive Flutter project consisting of two main assignments: UI flow and API-driven Authentication.

## 📌 Assignment 1: UI & Navigation
This assignment focuses on the visual flow and user experience of the initial app stages.
*   **Splash Screen**: Professional entry point with a custom-designed logo.
*   **Onboarding Flow**: 
    *   3-page interactive carousel (Reading, Library, Community).
    *   Smooth transitions using `PageView`.
    *   Progress indicator (dots) and skip functionality.
*   **Login Screen**: Clean, responsive UI for user sign-in.

## 📌 Assignment 2: Authentication & Services
This assignment focuses on networking, service integration, and error handling.
*   **REST API Integration**: Uses [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) as the authentication backend.
*   **Dio Package**: Implements robust HTTP POST requests for the login flow.
*   **State Handling**:
    *   **Success**: Displays a success SnackBar with the generated JWT token.
    *   **Failure**: Captures and shows error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials") via SnackBar.
